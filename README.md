# Tic-Tac-Toe

Play against a Tic-Tac-Toe engine on two game modes:
1) Normal Tic-Tac-Toe: Win the game by making three in a row.
2) Reverse Tic-Tac-Toe: Win the game by making the other player make three in a row.

Running the game:
```
python main.py
```


Collecting data (if need to test other states):
```
python solve.py
```

Tic Tac Toe engine was built through a minimax tree search on possible Tic Tac Toe game states and dynamic programming was used to speed up calculations.
